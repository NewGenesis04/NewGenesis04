# 👋 Hey there, I’m Ogie (aka @NewGenesis04)

I'm a curious builder with a thing for smart tech and deep systems.Whether it’s teaching machines how to think, building robust systems, or exploring how data shapes decisions — I’m all in.

## 🧠 What I'm Into
- 🤖 **Machine Learning & AI** – I love building stuff that *learns* and *adapts*.
- 🛠 **Backend Development** – APIs, authentication, data pipelines, system architecture — the good stuff.
- 📈 **Quantitative Development** – The art of weaving numbers, logic, and code into systems that see patterns, predict motion, and profit from precision.
- 🌍 **Geographical Information Systems (GIS)** – Location intelligence, analysing spatial data, and visualising patterns that live in space and time.
## 🔧 Tech I Use
- **Languages**: Python (my go-to), SQL
- **Frameworks**: Flask, FastAPI, Agent Development Kit, Langchain, CrewAI, GeoPandas
- **Tools**: Excel (yep, it's still powerful), Postman, Git, Docker, Linux, PostGIS, QuantConnect

## 🔍 Projects
Here are some of my highlighted repositories:

- [Blog API](https://github.com/NewGenesis04/Blog-API): A clean, modular REST API for blogs, users, followers, and comments. Built with FastAPI and JWT auth.
- [InventoryFlow](https://github.com/NewGenesis04/InventoryFlow): An inventory tracking system with smart restock alerts and analytics. Designed for real-world scalability and clarity.
- [International Breweries](https://github.com/NewGenesis04/International-Breweries): A deep dive into brewery operations and production data, a complete SQL analysis.

Feel free to explore these projects to see what I’ve been working on!

## 🌱 Currently Learning
- More advanced ML concepts (explainability, MLOps, all that jazz)
- Sharpening my quant chops — optimising portfolios, modelling risk, and finding the fine line between signal and noise (and profit).
- Getting lost in advanced GIS — spatial analytics, geostatistics, and making maps that tell real stories with data.
- Cloud architecture (hello AWS & GCP)

## 🤝 Let's Collaborate!
Got a cool idea? Want to build something useful? Or geek out over system design? I’m down. Always looking for opportunities to learn by doing.
