# 👋 Hey there, I’m Ogie (aka @NewGenesis04)

I'm a curious builder with a thing for smart tech and deep systems. Whether it's teaching machines how to think, building robust backends, or diving into cyber security rabbit holes — I'm all in.

## 🧠 What I'm Into
- 🤖 **Machine Learning & AI** – Building stuff that *learns* and *adapts*.
- 🛠 **Backend Development** – APIs, data pipelines, system architecture — the good stuff.
- 🛡 **Cyber Security** – Because breaking things (legally) makes you better at protecting them.

## 🔧 Tech I Use
- **Languages**: Python (my go-to), SQL
- **Frameworks**: Flask, FastAPI
- **Tools**: Excel (yep, it's still powerful), Postman, Git, Docker

## 🌱 Currently Learning
- More advanced ML concepts (explainability, MLOps, all that jazz)
- Cloud architecture (hello AWS & GCP)
- Security practices for production-grade apps

## 🤝 Let's Collaborate!
Got a cool idea? Want to build something useful? Or geek out over system design? I’m down. Always looking for opportunities to learn by doing.
